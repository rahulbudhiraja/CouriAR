Exploring Interaction Techniques with HMD and Mobile Phones for Outdoor AR.

Abstract:With Google's Project Glass releasing in a couple of months,There is a widespread interest and hope that the usage of HMDS will become common because of their small form factor . Although using HMDs can be very useful for overlaying Visual Information,Some operations are better suited on Handheld Devices such as text entry,gestures etc.
In this talk ,I will talk about some of the interaction techniques that we have developed for this purpose.Since this project is a collaboration between HITLab and BlackBay ,I shall also describe some use cases of our system for the Courier Service Industy.
